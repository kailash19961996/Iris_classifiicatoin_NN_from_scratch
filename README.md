# Multi-Class Iris Classification: From Scratch to Excel

In this project, I have explored the world of multi-class classification from two different angles - building a neural network from scratch and developing an Excel-based solution.

## Neural Network from Scratch
- Implemented a custom neural network architecture, including fully connected layers, activation functions, and a softmax output layer.
- Trained the model using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, optimizing the hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

## Excel-based Solution
- Developed a comprehensive Excel-based model that can also perform multi-class classification tasks.
- Leveraged Excel's powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities, including formulas, pivot tables, and conditional formatting.
- Demonstrated the versatility of Excel in tackling complex machine learning problems, even without specialized programming skills.

## Key Highlights
- Compared the performance and trade-offs between the neural network and Excel-based approaches, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each.
- Emphasized the importance of understanding the fundamentals of machine learning, whether through custom implementation or using readily available tools like Excel.
- Showcased the ability to tackle multi-class classification problems using both cutting-edge deep learning techniques and traditional data analysis methods.

## Challenges Addressed
1. **Neural Network Architecture Design**: Determining the optimal network structure, activation functions, and hyperparameters for the multi-class classification task.
2. **Excel Model Complexity**: Ensuring the Excel-based solution can handle large-scale datasets and complex decision boundaries without compromising performance or usability.
3. **Deployment and Interactivity**: Enabling seamless deployment and user interaction for both the neural network and Excel-based models.

## Future Improvements
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Exploring the integration of the neural network and Excel-based models to leverage the strengths of both approaches.
2. **Automated Feature Engineering**: Implementing techniques to automatically engineer relevant features for the multi-class classification problem.
3. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Enhancing the scalability and computational efficiency of both the neural network and Excel-based solutions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my versatility in tackling multi-class classification problems using both cutting-edge deep learning techniques and traditional data analysis tools. By exploring these two approaches, I've gained a deeper understanding of the trade-offs and considerations involved in building robust and effective classification models.
